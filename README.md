## Kubernetes for scaling monolithic and microservice based application

### Problem Statement
Building on top of docker assignment, it’s now time to scale your application that you built.

Figure out how to re-use your containerized application and deploy it in a k8s cluster (could be ‘kind’ or any other k8s compatible cluster).
Now, break your application down into Microservices based architecture. 
Show the breakdown in an architecture diagram and then 
Deploy this new application on kubernetes
Deliverables:
A document outlining the architecture of your application (before and after)
Kubernetes yamls, github repo link to your codebase.
Screenshot of your k8s running state (pods/services), screenshots of your application.
